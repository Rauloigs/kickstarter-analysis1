# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

## Description of the Analysis

Louise is looking to kickstart a campaign, so we got a bunch of data with different categories and subcateogries of different kickstarter campaigns to analyse and be able to tell Louise a recommendation of how to pursue her goal according to facts to make her increase the probabilities of success.

## Theater Foundings

According to Theater category, which is our interest for Louise, **Theater is from the two categories with the most success**. So this means that a kickstarter campaign for a theater event has big chances. Good luck Louise.

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

LouiseÂ´s came close to her fundraising goal. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns performed in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. We are going to use the same data to extract this information and analyse how so is that Louise came that close to the goal or why not completely. 

### Purpose

Is to provide Louise with the information she needs so she can make her own conclusions about her output campaign. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In the following table we can observe that the two months were the performance increaser were May and June. It is also interesting to see that either failed and successful campaigns follow the same pattern through the year, although successful campaigns had the greatest outcome.

Canceled campaigns have not an outstanding behavior. Mostly the graph shows that campaigns either fail or succeed. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

In this analysis its clearly seen that most of the successful campaigns reached around 80% and 100% of the goal pledged, and that this happened in two bins: *25,000 - 29,999 & 45,000 - 49,999*.

On the other side, failed campaigns tend to happened the most in a widther bin (*35,000 - 49,999*) and at 70% of the pledged goal. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

1. If you are kickstarting a campaigns it might be suitable to start between **may and june**.
2. **First and last two months of the year** are not good months to kickstart.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

1. Campaigns with less than 1000 pledged can reach an important amount of the goal, so its also recommendable to have a low goal. 
2. 100% of successful campaigns reached the goal at a high investmente (goal) which was 45,000 - 49,000. So this bin might be also a safe bet. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

At the moment I cannot think about limitations, it depedns on what the analysis is asking for. Though for this analysis I am pleased with the data.  

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

* Outputs vs Years. This could help to see if there are any relevant tendencies through years, to be more certain about the data. 
* Outputs vs Country. To see how probable is to have success. 
* Outputs vs Topics. Also an important feedback to have for Luoise.
